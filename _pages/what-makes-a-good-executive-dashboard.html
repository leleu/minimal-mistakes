<h2>The Right Questions</h2>
<p>Great reports start with asking the right questions.  Start by writing down the types of decisions are necessary to run your business.  Some common questions:</p>
<ul>
	<li>How much money am I making each month?</li>
	<li>How am I doing compared to projections?</li>
	<li>Am I spending to budget in my marketing spend?</li>
	<li>What is my customer retention rate?</li>
	<li>How happy are my customers?</li>
	<li>How is my Sales team doing?</li>
</ul>

<h2>De-Silo Data</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Strategic decisions require a holistic view</li>
	<li>A quantitative 50k foot view of your business should include sales, marketing, customer service, and projections.</li>
	<li>Avoid Vendor lock-in when you own your data</li>
</ul>



<h2>Automate Analysis</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Exporting csv or Excel files is time consuming and error prone</li>
	<li>Fine for learning what reports you use, but require a lot of effort for each new report</li>
	<li>Analysts can spend more time exploring the data, less time loading it</li>
</ul>
