> “It’s an absolute myth that you can send an algorithm over raw data and have insights pop up." [NYTimes.com](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/technology/for-big-data-scientists-hurdle-to-insights-is-janitor-work.html)

## Summary
* Data Wrangling and ETL are necessary preparatory steps before generating valuable nuggets
* Data Scientists spend a lot of time doing tasks they don't like and aren't well trained for
* Liberate your data scientists with automation, an in-house hire, or external contractors
* Better focus on extracting insights will make data science efforts much more nimble

## Disparate Sources
Raw data comes from a lot of different sources.  Databases on different machines, csv files on disk.  JSON that must be queried from remote APIs.  Some data that must be scraped from HTML.

Additionally, data from organic sources (e.g. tweet data) will have misspellings and inconsitent representations.

And it all needs to be cleaned, pre-processed, combined into a unified schema, and made available to Data Scientists for analysis.

> "Data wrangling is a huge — and surprisingly so — part of the job.  It’s something that is not appreciated by data civilians. At times, it feels like everything we do.” - Monica Rogati, vice president for data science at Jawbone.

## It's a Lot of Time
Estimates vary how much time is spent by data scientists on data janitor tasks.  [One study suggests 50-80%](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/technology/for-big-data-scientists-hurdle-to-insights-is-janitor-work.html) of their time.  [Another survey](http://community.datacamp.com.s3.amazonaws.com/community/production/ckeditor_assets/pictures/393/content_infographic_fixed.jpg) found at least 25% of their time was spent doing these tasks.

## Data Scientists' Least Favorite Task
The work can be tedious and mind numbing.  Many data scientists spent years doing graduate level mathematics and earned PhDs, and [don't want to spend their time as data janitors](https://amplitude.com/blog/2016/07/19/stop-treating-data-scientist-like-janitor/).  [Surveys](https://www.forbes.com/sites/gilpress/2016/03/23/data-preparation-most-time-consuming-least-enjoyable-data-science-task-survey-says/#31189ab36f63) regularly show it's [their least favorite part of the job](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3047584/big-data/hottest-job-data-scientists-say-theyre-still-mostly-digital-janitors.html)

## Liberate Your Data Scientists
Teams with more than a few data scientists should look at hiring a data engineer.  Everyone should look at [automation](https://trifacta.com) or [crowdsourcing](https://crowdflower.com) options.  Smaller teams lacking automation experience should consider contracting the work to a specialist.
