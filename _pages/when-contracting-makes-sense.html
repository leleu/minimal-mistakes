Repurposing in-house developers impacts your product timeline.  Executive Dashboards require work up front, but few hours to maintain, making it an ideal project to task out

<h2>Contractor Advantages</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Fast implementation time</li>
	<li>Specialized knowledge reduces errors</li>
	<li>Data Governance expertise</li>
	<li>Engineering can focus on product</li>
</ul>


<h2>Build Your Own Executive Dashboard</h2>

<p>Building makes sense if you're just getting started.  If you have the time to piece together a "good enough" solution, that can get be cost effective if your team has the bandwidth for a additional projects.  

If your eCommerce system has Google Analytics out of the box integration, go with that.  Google Analytics has an exceptionally powerful reporting UI, making it easy for anyone to put together their own dashboards.</p>

<h3>Easy Integrations with Google Analytics</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Shopify</li>
	<li>Wordpress</li>
	<li>Magento</li>
	<li>Shopify</li>
</ul>

<p>However, if your current reports aren't meeting your needs, or you haven't had time to build out the reports you need, it makes sense to hire a contractor.  Your engineering team can remain focused on the core product, while the external team can integrate with first- and third-party systems in parallel.</p>
